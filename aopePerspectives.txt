The purpose of the AoPE registrar program is clear and well defined
I understand the differences between each AoPE
AoPEs are generally misunderstood by psychologists
AoPEs are generally misunderstood by the public
Some AoPEs are more important than others
Some AoPEs are more relevant than others
The AoPE registrar program is appropriately designed to maximise competency development
There are too many AoPEs
There are not enough AoPEs
There is no need to formally extend on the training completed to acquire general registration by completing an AoPE registrar program
AoPEs are necessary to ensure a diversity of skills and knowledge within the psychology profession
There is overlap between the work I do and the work of a colleague endorsed in a different area of practice
There should be different competency requirements for different registration types
