abstract: |
  Training and registration of psycholoigsts in Australia has undergone significant change in the last two decades. In particular, the manner in which psychologists obtain an Area of Practice Endorsement, and how this is differentially recognised by governmental bodies has been controversial. Despite ongoing consultation regarding improvements to training, registration and the Area of Practice Endorsement system, there is a paucity of empirical research about psychologists attitudes towards these changes and the ways in which psychologists in Australia are recognised. The current study utilises a mixed methods methodology to quantitatively and qualitatively examine Australian psychologists perceptions of training, Area of Practice Endorsements, and the Medicare Better Access to Mental Health Scheme. One sentence summarizing the main result (with the words "**here we show**" or their equivalent). Two or three sentences explaining what the **main result** adds to previous knowledge. One or two sentences to put the results into a more **general context**. Two or three sentences to provide a **broader perspective**, readily comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline.

Psychologists' pathways to registration has gone through several changes in the past two decades (). More recently there has been an increasing focus on Area of Practice Endorsements (AoPE) and how these relate to the Medicare Better Access to Mental Health Scheme (BAMHS). Despite frequent criticism in news and social media of what is perceived as a "two tiered" compensation system that has been enforced by Medicare and creates misconceptions within the public about the skill sets of psychologists, there is no empirical evidence regarding psychologists' attitudes and perspectives of the efficacy and appropriateness of their training, the AoPE system and the BAMHS. 

As important stakeholders in the treatment of mental health problems in Australia, psychologists are in a unique position to provide input about training, recognition of different skillsets (such as detailed in the AoPE system) and the structure of schemes designed to assist the public accessing mental health support. In order to support conceptualisation of appropriate training programs and funding schemes there needs to be empirical evidence about the effectiveness of different professions or training programs in addressing mental health problems; there is a paucity of such research, and even less research on the perspectives of psychologists. Gaining insights into psychologists perspectives of these matters would assist with development of targeted research in these domains, as well as begins to provide an empirical basis for which governmental bodies and peak professional bodies can support changes and innovation.

Discuss the research that has addressed this problem

Identify the deficiencies in the literature and what knowledge is needed

Identify audiences that will benefit from addressing this gap

The opinions of peak bodies, governmental reports and the available literature demonstrate the diversity of the psychology profession in Australia. Relying purely on qualitative methods do not provide opportunity for input from the wider profession. On the other hand, relying purely on quantitative measures is inadequate to fully describe the nuanced opinions of psychologists. Therefore the aim of this study was to obtain a large sample of psychologists opinions and perspectives via a quantitative survey, while gaining further insight into opinions via qualitative interviews.

# Methods

## Participants

There were `r nrow(data)` participants in the quantitative component of this research. There were `r nrow(filter(data, gender == "Female"))` females, `r nrow(filter(data, gender == "Male"))` males and `r nrow(filter(data, gender == "Other"))` participants who did not provide their gender or did not identify with a binary gender. There were `r nrow(filter(data, currentRegistration == "General"))` participants with General Registration, `r nrow(filter(data, currentRegistration == "Non-Practicing"))` Non-Practicing Registration and `r nrow(filter(data, currentRegistration == "Provisional"))` with Provisional Registration. There were `r nrow(filter(data, supervisor == "Yes"))` participants that identified that they were Psychology Board of Australia approved supervisors. Other descriptive statistics are provided for age (Table \@ref(tab:ageParticipants)), Area of Practice Endorsement (AoPE) (Table \@ref(tab:aopeParticipants)), training pathway (Table \@ref(tab:trainingPathwayParticipants)), years of experience (Table \@ref(tab:yearsExperienceParticipants)), work setting (Table \@ref(tab:workSettingParticipants)), and client age (Table \@ref(tab:clientAgeParticipants)).

There were `r nrow(qual_data)` participants that provided their contact details for participation in the qualitative component of this research. While attempting to balance the inclusion of a variety fo psychologists with different training, approved AoPE and professional experiences, 29 participants were contacted for participation with 15 participants responding and ultimately participating. 

## Material

A list of questions used in the online questionnaire (including variable name and question), and an example of the interview schedule are both available in the Appendix.

## Procedure

For the purpose of our study, we invited participants to complete a series of questions about their opinion on the Better Access Scheme, perspectives about training to be a psychologist in Australia, and attitudes towards AoPE in Australia. At the end of this questionnaire, participants were offered the opportunity to provide their contact details to researchers so that they could be contacted to participate in an interview. There was no way to match a participants responses on the questionnaire to their interview data.

Participants that provided their contact details for inclusion in the qualitative component of this research were contacted via email to confirm their inclusion. Once confirmed participants selected a time of their convenience and the interviews were conducted by one of the three authors via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). Interviews took approximately 20 to 60 minutes. Stuff about probing questions and structure of interview... Stuff abut the method of qualitative analysis...

Qualitative and quantitative data collection was carried out for approximately 6 months in 2020 in a concurrent manner.

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses. Readers can access the R code used to generate this manuscript at [GitHub](https://github.com/jakekraska/psychtraining). In order to account for small _n_ in certain demographics, groups were collapsed. For example Area of Practice Endorsement was collapsed into those that do and do not possess an AoPE, and all of those with a DPsych, MPsych, or MPsych/PhD were collapsed into "Higher Degree"..

```{r collapseGroups}

data$aope.collapse <- fct_collapse(data$aope,
                              None = "None",
                              other_level = "Endorsed")

data$trainingPathway.collapse <- fct_collapse(data$trainingPathway,
                                       "4+2" = "4+2",
                                       "5+1" = "5+1",
                                       "Higher Degree" = c("DPsych","MPsych","MPsych/PhD"),
                                       "Ongoing" = "Ongoing")

```

# Results

Results for the this study are broken down into three categories of perspectives on (1) Training, (2) Area of Practice Endorsement (AoPE) and (3) the Medicare Better Access to Mental Health Scheme (BAMHS). As the quantitative study included 59 questions, with nine demographic categories, a total of `9*59` independent analyses would be required to compare all differences. Rather than blindly analysing differences in response patterns (which would likely result in a high chance erroneous inferences, particularly Type I errors), statistical analyses will focus on those trends identified in previous literature, those items in which high variability is evident (often supported by high standard deviations) or there is a clear pattern of response (often supported by extreme skew or kurtosis values and high or low mean values)

Readers can access visualisations of the response patterns on the [Shiny App](https://jakekraska.shinyapps.io/psychtraining/) developed for this research project.

## Perspectives on Psychology Training

Descriptive statistics for the items relating to perspectives about psychology training are contained in Table \@ref(tab:trainingDescriptives). Questions focused on perspectives of training related to satisfaction with participants own training, whether the training equipped participants with sufficient knowledge and prepared them for practice as a psychologist, perspectives on satisfactory and preferred training pathways, and clarity surrounding pathways to registration and competencies. 

```{r trainingDescriptives}

data %>%
  select(all_of(trainingQuestions)) %>%
  describe(ranges = FALSE) %>%
  rename("Item" = "vars",
         "_n_" = "n",
         "_m_" = "mean",
         "_SD_" = "sd",
         "Skew" = "skew",
         "Kurtosis" = "kurtosis",
         "_SE_" = "se") %>%
  kable(caption = "Descriptive Statistics for Training Questions", digits = 2)

```

Across all participants, the most significant variability related to whether participants were considering undertaking an Area of Practice Endorsement bridging program (_m_ = `r mean(data$trainingPathway_4, na.rm = TRUE)`, _SD_ = `r sd(data$trainingPathway_4, na.rm = TRUE)`). There was a strong agreement across participants that existing training prepares psychologists appropriately for ethical challenges (_m_ = `r mean(data$trainingPathway_9, na.rm = TRUE)`, _SD_ = `r sd(data$trainingPathway_9, na.rm = TRUE)`), but there was more variability concerning preparation for legal matters (_m_ = `r mean(data$trainingPathway_10, na.rm = TRUE)`, _SD_ = `r sd(data$trainingPathway_10, na.rm = TRUE)`).

```{r trainingPCA}

trainingfit <- princomp(drop_na(data[trainingQuestions]), cor = TRUE)
summary(trainingfit)
print(loadings(trainingfit), cutoff = 0.3, sort = TRUE)
screeplot(trainingfit, type = "l", npcs = 10, main = "Screeplot of the first 10 PCs")
abline(h = 1, col="red", lty=5)
trainingfit$scores
biplot(trainingfit)

trainingfit <- principal(drop_na(data[trainingQuestions]), nfactors = 3, rotate = "varimax")
trainingfit
print(loadings(trainingfit), cutoff = 0.3, sort = TRUE)
biplot(trainingfit)

```

Using Principal Components Analysis, the responses to questions clearly focused in on three domains that we have labelled "Clarity of Pathways" (Items 1-4 and Items 27-28), "Adequacy of Training" (Items 5-19 and Item 26), and "Pathways to Registration" (Items 20-25 and Item 29).

### Pathways to Registration

There was noticeable variation in the "satisfactory" and "preferred" pathways for registration as a general psychologist. At face value the perspectives of psychologists were that the Higher Degree programs were the most satisfactory (_m_ = `r mean(data$trainingPathway_24, na.rm = TRUE)`, _SD_ = `r sd(data$trainingPathway_24, na.rm = TRUE)`) and that the 4+2 internship was not preferred (_m_ = `r mean(data$trainingPathway_21, na.rm = TRUE)`, _SD_ = `r sd(data$trainingPathway_21, na.rm = TRUE)`). Despite not being preferred, the perspective about whether the 4+2 internship was satisfactory was somewhat neutral (_m_ = `r mean(data$trainingPathway_20, na.rm = TRUE)`, _SD_ = `r sd(data$trainingPathway_20, na.rm = TRUE)`).

```{r trainingPerspectivesAoPE}

higher.degree.t <- apa_print(t.test(trainingPathway_24 ~ aope.collapse, data = data))

```

```{r trainingPerspectivesTraining, fig.cap = "Higher Degree Programs are a Satisfactory Pathway"}

ggplot(filter(data, !is.na(trainingPathway_24), !is.na(trainingPathway.collapse)), 
       aes(y = trainingPathway_24, x = trainingPathway.collapse)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun.data = give.n, geom = "text", fun = median) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean.n, geom = "text", fun = mean, colour = "red") +
  theme_apa() +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Agreement") +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Training Pathway")

```

Those with AoPE are more positive about the higher degree pathways than those without, `r higher.degree.t$full_result`. This is likely related to the training pathways that those with and without AoPE have taken, as displayed in \@ref(tab:trainingPerspectivesTraining).

### Adequacy of Training

### Clarity of Pathways

Most psychologists appeared to agree that the pathways to become a psychologist are complicated, (_m_ = `r mean(data$trainingPathway_28, na.rm = TRUE)`, _SD_ = `r sd(data$trainingPathway_28, na.rm = TRUE)`).
